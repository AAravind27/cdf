<h1>Previous Versions</h1>


<code>

14.05.06<br>

Improvements<br>
  [CDE-192] -         Added bootstrap as renderer<br>
  [CDF-254] -         Deprecate JSONscriptRequest in favour of $.getJSON<br>

<br>

Bugs:<br>
  [CDF-257] -         Load of script should be local, breaks when using https<br>
  [CDF-267] -         Getting js error (&#39;define&#39; is undefined) in EE Dashboard Designer in Firefox becuase of CDE<br>
  [CDF-252] -         Load of script should be local, breaks when using https<br>
  [BISERVER-10656] -  Fixed issue with multiple dashboards.initEngine calls<br>
  [ANALYZER-2548]  -  Sunburst slice proportions are not equivalent to the represented values' proportions<br>

14.03.07<br>
    * Got back on track with the cdf releases after the Pentaho 5 release<br>
    * [CDF-246] Upgraded OpenLayers to 2.13.1<br>
    * [CDF-245] Replaced tile map server on CDF reference "MapComponent (custom)"<br>
    * [CDF-244] Replaced Geolocation service: now using openstreetmaps<br>
    * [CDF-241] Updated documentation of Button Component<br>
    * [CDF-235] Pre-condition support for server-side action while clicking on a ButtonComponent. If expression() returns false, the action is not executed<br>
    * [CDF-230] Added support in CPK query type for kettleOutput and stepName control parameters.<br>
    * [CDF-227] Fixed bug where initializing CPK queries was not copying defaults.<br>
    * ActionComponents call render on update instead of draw<br>
    * [FIX] (SchedulePrptComponent IE9/8) Use of badly-supported/unsupported DOMElement.attributes caused scheduling to fail or be incomplete (http://quirksmode.org/dom/core/#attributes).<br>
    * Updated backbone.js to 1.1.0.<br>
    * Updated underscore.js to 1.5.2.<br>
    * [FEAT] (protovis QuantitativeScale ticks) When 2 ticks are asked for, then 2 ticks are given. It is always possible to take the start and end of the domain. Caused an infinite loop in CCC's horizontal numeric axis ticks calc. algorithm.<br>
    * [FIX] (protovis Swallowed Error) A catch that did not throw or log.<br>
    * [FIX] (protovis Area One Point) Calling a function with the wrong name. Occurred only in areas with a single instance.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC plots base axis order nulls visible) When multiple plots where shown, and had null interpolation, and some series were hidden, the plots could render the categories in an order different to that of the base axis. This was noticeable in the line/area plot.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC legend extension points) A recent regression. The indexes of the legend extension points, for the several colorAxis/dataCell, (legendDot_, legend2Dot_, etc) were not being correctly assigned.<br>
    * [FEAT] (CCC legend extension points) Ability to specify legend$Dot_ or legend$Rule_ to affect any legend group (1, 2 , 3...). Some more work is needed to provide the same legend group extension points separation to the legendPanel_, legendMarkerPanel_ and legendLabel_.<br>
    * [FEAT] (CCC Bar-family BarOrthoSizeMin) New option for the bar family of charts, allowing to control how zero-bar-height values are shown.<br>
    * [CDF-214] CDF Table component with paginateServerSide:true not working properly<br>
    * [ANALYZER-2098] When dimension is used as Multi-chart level it damages sort order of child chart.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC Legend Align) Two bugs in layout code that would cause misalignments.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC Pie Panel Legend) When all the categories were set to invisible, by using the legend, the panel would internally throw and invalid data exception, which resulted in a chart with no legend to be able to make categories visible again. Changed the level at which the exception is caught, so that it shows on each plot's panel instead. Also, now only throwing the exception when there are any categories, but their values do not allow representation.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC Bar BarWidth) Calculation of barWidth for single series included more margin than it should.<br>
    * [IMP] (CCC Legend Tooltip) only show legend tooltip when the text of the legend item was trimmed.<br>
    * [FEAT] (CCC Bar antialias) Auto-antialiasing bars when their width, or the space between is small enough that the pixel rounding results in perceptible different bar widths and/or spacing.<br>
    * Include Backbone.Events in the prototype of every BaseComponent and only have Dashboards mix it in to and object if it's not already available.<br>
<br>



13.09.10<br>

    * Query add-ins makes it easier to add new datasource types to CDF<br>
    * Make pvSparkline rendering respect canvas margin<br>
    * [FEAT] (CCC MultiChart Overflow) New option multiChartOverflow controls whether to 'grow' (the default value), 'fit' or 'clip' if small charts would otherwise not fit in the initially given chart size.<br>
    * [FEAT] (protovis Symbols) Ability to register new kinds of Symbols (i.e. new shape types for pv.Dot). pv.Scene.registerSymbol.<br>
    * [FEAT] (protovis pv.Dot aspectRatio) Dots now support the creation of rectangles and ellipsis, through the use of the new "aspectRatio" mark property.<br>
    * [FEAT] Implementation of [ANALYZER-1711] Avoid empty charts for all-null-or-zero data: * (protovis band layout) added small visible bars, centered at the axis, for bands with nothing but zero-or-null-values. This affects BarChart, NormalizedBarChart and WaterfallChart. * (ccc Pie) +InvalidDataException is thrown, in non-multi-chart pie charts, causing a message to be printed, in place of the chart.<br>
    * [FEAT] (SelectBaseComponent changeMode) Readded the 'timeout-focus' value of option "changeMode".  Distant scrolling is now handled by resetting the timeout counter when scroll occurs. Also, different timeouts control click/select changes ans scrolling.<br>
    * [FEAT] (SelectBaseComponent changeMode) Moved option changeMode from SelectMultiComponent to the base class. Removed option changeTimeout. ChangeMode now only has options 'immediate' and 'focus'. Timeout behavior was still not good in scroll-to-distant-item selection cases.<br>
    * [FEAT](CCC CartesianAxis FixedMin/Max options) The FixedMin and FixedMax options now support reading values in the corresponding dimension's source format - the one used to read data from the data source.<br>
    * [FEAT](CCC timeSeries FixedMin/Max options) Cartesian axes of Date type now also support the FixedMin and FixedMax options (until now only implemented for numeric axes).<br>
    * [FEAT](CCC timeSeries) The default converter created for date dimensions now accepts numbers (date in milliseconds), Date objects, as well as the already supported strings in the default/specified date format.    This affects data source reading, but, as well, of "FixedMin" and "FixedMax" cart. axis options and of base values specified in the pvc.CartesianChart#markEvent method. ----<br>
    * [FEAT] (Dashboards.normalizeValue) New method for starting to kill the "empty" value confusion. The following are all considered equivalent, and converted to null: null, undefined, "", [] .<br>
    * [FEAT] (Dashboards.isArray) New method for uniformizing what is considered an array accross multiple component implementations. [FIX] (SelectMultiComponent) An empty value, compared to a null value, was being considered a value change and caused the dashboard processing it on startup...<br>
    * [FEAT] (Dashboards.equalValues) New method abstracts the logic required to compare CDF parameter values, whether they are multiple or not.<br>
    * [FEAT] (SelectMultiComponent changeMode) Added options changeMode and changeTimeout, applicable whrn isMultiple is true.     The default changeMode is 'immediate' and corresponds to legacy behavior.     The new changeMode is 'timeout-focus' and waits for a given time before considering a change, a change.     Care was taken to support Android and iPad/iPhone. In this devices, the immediate mode is used, cause they already show a popup that allows the user to make multiple choices.     Yet, the code now guarantees that a change is only signaled when the user dismisses the popup.<br>
    * [FEAT] (Dashboards) New "eachValuesArray" method for enumerating the commonly used values array.<br>
    * [FEAT] (Dashboards) New "parseMultipleValues" method which contains common logic for parsing a parameter value into its multiple values.<br>
    * [FEAT] (InputBaseComponent) New "#_getParameterValue" method which contains a many times repeated pattern of getting and evaluating the value of a component's bound parameter.<br>
    * [FEAT] (protovis Bullet layout) Added a mark-wide property "originIsZero" to allow preventing that zero is always part of the scale. Also added the "minimum" mark property, to pair with the existing "maximum" mark property.<br>
    * [CHG](CCC timeSeries) Improved code of time series scale calculation in that it now better handles degenerate conditions like 0-length or negative length intervals.<br>
    * [CDF-194] (Dashboards.hsvToRgb) Rewrote the algorithm directly from the source at http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ncs/color/t_convert.html<br>
    * PDB-1571: License Attribution<br>
    * [PRD-3687] (SelectBaseComponent timeout-focus) Adjusted default timeout values.<br>
    * Fixed bug with QueryComponent where server calls were being run asynchronously, which causes lifecycle inconsistencies on managed components.<br>
    * Fixed bug where select components were not cleaning the selection even with defaultIfEmpty flag set to false. Added a component property as support for for a data-placeholder attribute.<br>
    * Dashboards object conversion functions between properties arrays and objects now do nothing if the arguments is already of the intended conversion type.<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-92]- Max and Min options in dataBar addIn not considering 0 values.<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-1828] - New Async Framework gets stuck in waiting mode....<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-2250] - Error OrientDB<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-2266] - Rendering of pvSparkline...<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-2409] - Error refreshing individual CCC2 components<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-1040] - Properties of the MonthPicker component are expecting date objects and getting strings<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-1525] - tableComponent: search box (filter) doesn't work with "Paginate server-side"<br>
    * [FIX] (pvcBaseChart#setData) NPE occurring when an null or empty data is supplied to #setData.<br>
    * [FIX] (clearSelectionMode focusWindow) When selectionMode='focuswindow' clicking an empty area would clear the selection.<br>
    * [FIX] (NPE nodata allowNoData TranslationOper) When data was set to null and the chart allowed having no data (like the BulletChart does), a NPE would occur.   Now, setting data to null always results in setting it to an empty array.<br>
    * [FIX] (log level) Some log calls were not using the correct level method.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC MultiChartOverflow Tooltip) When non-interactive, an error would be thrown when defining the tooltip.<br>
    * [FIX] (NPE Log Comp Lifecycle) Component lifecycle would continue to be logged after component had been removed from the dashboards.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC Render multiple animation) Problems when rendering and re-rendering, possibly with multiple charts to the same canvas, and animations.<br>
    * [FIX] (SelectBaseComponent#draw) A bug where the firstVal variable would remain undefined, despite existing at least one valuesArray element.<br>
    * [FIX] (SelectBaseComponent#draw) The whole currentIsValid determination was erroneously validating possible values (valuesArray) against the currentValues, instead of the opposite.<br>
    * [FIX] (SelectBaseComponent#draw) When !defaultIsEmpty and no currentValue existed an parameter change would be fired despite the assumed default value would be empty as the initial one.<br>
    * [FIX] (SelectBaseComponent#draw) Normalized the empty/invalid condition for assuming a default value accross the multiple and non-multiple cases.<br>
    * [FIX] (MultiButtonComponent#draw) A NPE bug that could occur if the current value was «null».<br>
    * [FIX] (input.js) Some other inadvertently global variable fixes and small code cleanup/refactoring.<br>
    * [FIX] (protovis) NPE occuring when a handler is registered for page load, after the page load had occurred. No event object is available in that situation.<br>
    * [FIX](CCC userSelectionAction) Documentation stated that the handler supplied a pvc.visual.Context as JS content/this but it was being called on the global object.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC plot2SeriesIndex dataPart) Bug that occurred when an explicit reader for the "dataPart" dimension were defined, in a *relational* resultset.     The option plot2SeriesIndexes was being registered even though the dataPart dimension was already being read.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC extension points) Do not intercept protovis pseudo-properties (those not in the Mark#properties hash).<br>
    * Added a 'vis' property to the protovis component, containing the root prototis pv.Panel. This makes it easier to later access the panel, from an event handler of the component itself, or, more importantly, from another CDE component.<br>
    * [REF](protovis Dom) Some code optimizations and made the childNodes property, initially, an array of the prototype, being created locally on firt child addition.<br>
    * [REF](CCC Data childNodes) Removed the duplicate _children property of the Data class.    Now always using the childNodes property provided by the pv.Dom class mixin.    Also all direct accesses to te data._childrenByKey property were replaced by a call to data.child(key).<br>
    * [REF] (CCC Selection) Small refactorings and cleanup on selection code<br>
    * [REF] (SelectBaseComponent) Refactored the code. Also, in #draw explicitly declared local variable "selectHTML" and removed unused variables "hasValueSelected", "isSelected".<br>
    * CDF now uses cpf-core and cpf-pentaho<br>
<br>
13.06.05<br>
    * New Layout for samples<br>
    * Implemented [REDMINE-2120] - 	Adapt PrptComponent for post, auto-resize, progress indicator on report load<br>
    * Updated heat grid sample due ccc version update<br>
    * Added SchedulePrpt Component<br>
    * [FEAT](CCC Extension Scenes Legend Item) New kind of extension points: Scene Variables extension points. Allow overriding the calculation of CCC scene variables. This is useful for things like changing the text of discrete ticks or legend items in a way that layout takes it into account. Normal "axisLabel_text" and "legendLabel_text" extension points are not taken into account by the automatic layout algorithms because they cannot be safely used in a context were protovis marks do not yet exist (as is the case). These are not suitable to be used when the size of panels is determined automatically. In practice, for now, there's a single new extension point: "legendItemScene_value" (or "legend2ItemScene_value", ..., and "legend$ItemScene_value", for any legend group) that allows changing the label of the legend item's scene variable 'value'.<br>
    * [CHG](dataSeparator) The option "dataSeparator" now also controls the pvc.data.Complex composite key separator, besides the crosstab translation separator character<br>
    * [CHG] Removed the new Legend Item Scenes extension point syntax and instead exposed the already existing JSON legend.scenes.item.value property.<br>
    * [FEAT](CCC plot2DataSeriesIndexes) Restored the functionality exposed by the deprecated option "secondAxisIdx".<br>
    * [CHG] (CCC plot2SeriesIndexes) On third thought, renamed the option plot2DataSeriesIndexes to plot2SeriesIndexes, although the current implementation stilll works like the deprecated v1 secondAxisIdx. The meaning of "series" should already be taken as the value of the "series" visual role.<br>
    * PRD-4429 Multi-value parameter - Select and de-select issue<br>
    * [FEAT] (Dashboards.getComponentIndex) The single argument now also supports a number value.<br>
    * [FEAT][CHG] (Dashboards.removeComponent) The return value is not a boolean indicating if the component existed anymore, but the removed component when existing. Also, the single argument now also accepts the index of the component to remove.<br>
    * Changes made to Comments Components: - Verify permissions for each operation; - Verify if user is an admin to show deleted and archived comments; - Return additional data for the client (it´s possible for the administrators see deleted and archived comments); - Depending on permission It´s possible for the administartor change the deleted and archived comments; Added info the the "Dashboards.context": - So we can know if the user can do operations over comments form other user;<br>
    * [FEAT](CCC PiePlot offSetRadius) New extension point slice_offsetRadius allows to easily implement exploded-style-selection.<br>
    * doQuery handles null parameters, fetchData shouldn't be picky<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-271] TableComponent with server side pag. hangs with "processing" when query fails<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-2112] There isn't any class in the chart components series to represent the cccNormalizedBarChart<br>
    * Fixed [REDMINE-2083] refreshPeriod not working after component lifecycle changes<br>
    * [PERF] (CCC protovis) Performance improvements mostly noticeable on updateAll, due to avoiding DOM calls like the setAttribute/removeAttribute and style setting<br>
    * [FIX](CCC scene var valueOf) removed the valueOf method, that would gain to the toString method, when returning a number.<br>
    * [FIX](Dashboards._castControlToClass) While searching for the first of a set of candidate class names, ignore any global name whose value is not a function.<br>
    * [FIX](CGG) Small fix to debugging code of generated CGG script files.<br>
    * [FIX](pvc.setDebug) pvc.logError and pv.error weren't being updated on debug level change<br>
    * [FIX](protovis gradient OrdinalScale) Ordinal scales did not convert string ranges using pv.fillStyle but instead used pc.color. This caused a "colors" array containing gradient strings to not be correctly recognized.<br>
    * [FIX](CCC Translation metadata.type) Reverted the use of metadata.type to default a single bound dimensions' type, because this would cause other relevant defaults not to be applied.<br>
    * [FIX](protovis gradient multiple) Generally, multiple distinct gradients could render incorrectly, due to sharing of FillStyle/Color objects to store the multiple "color" urls that would refer to gradients defined in distinct parent elements. Urls would point to out-of-scope gradients. Now, all gradients are defined at the svg/defs element and are shared between FillStyles/Colors having the same key. There is no GC of gradients; it is assumed that the number of distinct gradients per root is relatively small, and that these are stable along consecutive renders.<br>
    * [FIX](CCC Waterfall) Bugs in ortho range calculation and water-group rectangles layout, sometimes revealed with the presence of negative values. There's still a bug with the placement of bars themselves.<br>
    * [FIX](CCC def.string.format) Bug in evaluating toString of objects. If an object had a valueOf method, the toString of the result of valueOf would be used instead.<br>
    * [FIX](CCC Waterfall WaterLineLabel-Placement) With negative values, water-line labels would sometimes be placed in the wrong position (above or below the line)<br>
    * [FIX](protovis Band Layout) For the stacked mode, a JS bug, would mess up negative values and cause the bars to be wrongly placed, affected the CCC waterfall chart only.<br>
    * [FIX](CCC AxisPanel LabelSpacing Vertical Number Ticks) The min label spacing for numeric label ticks, in vertical cartesian axes, was sometimes not being respected. Also fixed some AxisPanel existing bugs that surfaced when this one was uncovered.<br>
    * [FIX](CCC PointPlot ignoreNulls nullInterpolationMode) When not ignoring nulls and the null interpolation mode was not none, the point (area, line, dot) plot was not recognizing interpolated scenes. Some interpolation scenes have both the null datum and the interpolated one, which confused the rpevious detection method.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC Scales FixedMin/Max) The fixed minimum value of a numeric scale would get _switched_ with the maximum domain value when the fixed minimum was set to a value greater that the maximum domain value.<br>
    * [FIX] (CCC protovis) The window.getComputedStyle shim installed by protovis-msie caused problems to other libraries (ace). Refactored some of the code so that the shim is no longer necessary.<br>

    	* New chart type "NormalizedBarChart" (100% stacked/normalized/segmenred bar chart)<br>
    	* Added new "selectable" chart option that is false by default. Currently, selection is supported by BarChart/WaterfallChart and HeatGridChart.<br>
    	* Fixed Redmine Bug #193: BoxplotChart does not show box tooltips correctly<br>
    	* Fixed Redmine Bug #208: BarLine charts break when Independent Line Scale is set to false<br>
    	* Fixed Redmine Bug #298: Wrong extension point in ccc documentation<br>
    	* Fixed Redmine Bug #316 - Tooltips of Dots in line charts do not always appear<br>
    	* Fixed Redmine Bug #317 - Timeseries axes ticks, in some cases, get drawn far to the left, off the chart<br>
    	* Functions 'getZZZScale' now have a 'keyArgs'-like interface. This interface makes it easy to add new arguments to the functions.<br>
    	* Refactoring  pvcPanel.js into separate files.<br>
    	* Put classes in pvcCategoricalAbstract.js and pvcDataDimension.js into separate files<br>
    	* Fixed bug in value/label code of Categorical charts<br>
    	* Added support for value and label distinction, for title and subtitle, on the bullet chart.<br>
    	* Fixed ZOrder bug - did not detect correctly a new child with ZOrder already applied<br>
    	* Fixed tipsy tooltip issue with dots and lines hiding the tooltip imediately on mouseleave, which is incompatible with the point/unpoint pseudo-events, tipically used in these cases to attach the tipsy behavior.<br>
    	* Fixed pvc.mergeDefaults function that did copy specified options with an === undefined value<br>
    	* Added logging of received Metadata and resultset to DataEngine.<br>
    	* Added logging of received options, in pvc.Base#preRender.<br>
    	* DataDimension inherited code from Composite Ordinal Axes related to onversion of data to tree form and obtaining labels for its elements. New chart options 'getCategoryLabel' and 'getSeriesLabel'.<br>
    	* Click and Double-click in AxisPanel has been refactored to allow usage by other axis types, besides the composite axis (like linear and normal-ordinal).<br>
    	* Axis value selection is now integrated in the click event (and thus, xAxisClickAction and yAxisClickAction of HeatGrid have been removed).<br>
    	* Axis 'clickAction' and 'doubleClickAction' now receive an object argument that contains the properties: 'value', 'label', 'absValue', 'path', 'absLabel'. This breaks the previous interface of these handlers (its .toString method returns the 'value' property, to ensure some backward compatibility).<br>
    	* Ordinal axes have changed the type of "datum" that is passed to property functions. This can affect functions given tothe following extensions points: 'Ticks_', 'Label_', 'Grid_'. The "datum" received is equal to that described for the clickAction event handler.<br>
    	* Fixed bug in MetricAbstract that affected drawing of base linear axes.<br>
    	* Changed options handling by chart classes. They now all declare options in a static property called 'defaultOptions', which is handled in the instance constructor by the new function: pvc.mergeDefaults. This allowed that options would reach the root base class (which by difficulties in option handling in some cases were not passed to base classes), which was required so that the new "getLabel" options could reach the base class, by the time the DataEngine is created. This involved collecting all options of every chart class and placing a default for them in the defaultOptions object. Only options declared here are read from the user options.<br>
    	* Some refactoring of MultiValueTranslator.<br>
    	* Improved lasso selection, to behave better near min. width or height of selection rectangle (method _createSelectionOverlay lost the w and h arguments).<br>
    	* Fixed bug in the HeatGrid and Waterfall tooltip calculation code, that caused tooltips to be shown delayed one mark instance. To this end, a new method has been added to pv.Mark that allows defining a local mark property: 'localProperty'. This is in most situations a better choice that of using 'def', which isn't evaluated per instance of a Mark, but per build of a Mark.<br>
    	* Performance improvement on heatgrid: don't reevaluate tooltip when shapes are re-rendered<br>
    	* Solved lasso show delay<br>
    	* Fixed some bugs related to the timeSeries option being wrongly read on the panel or on the chart.<br>
    	* compositeAxis: issue with labels overlapping with map when aligned to the right<br>
    	* Fixed bug related to the last showTooltips change.<br>
    	* Normalized showTooltips option and tipsySettings options on Categorical charts.<br>
    	* Generalized categorical charts rubber band detection of selected data.<br>
    	* Added pvc.CategoricalAbstract#clearSelections method to support Pentaho Analyzer.<br>
    	* Solved missing ;<br>

	* Implemented Redmine Feature #109 - Rounded maximum for linear axis in categorical charts ("DomainRoundMode" option, including 2nd axis with independent scale)<br>
	* Solved Redmine Issue #120 - Axis labels get cut off<br>
	* Solved Redmine Issue #78 - Fix the vertical order in which series are drawn, so that when applicable, they show from top to bottom.<br>

	* workaround issue in 16th decimal position in IE9 64bit<br>
	* Fixed regression with bulletcharts being translated in 10px down<br>
	* Added new (and some of the missing) documentation to the testZZZ.html files<br>
	* Fixed the drawing of bars and grid lines on the ordinal scale: they were not centered with the tick and label<br>
	* In linear axis, made minorTicks "extend" (major)ticks, so that visibility (through .visible or .strokeStyle) of the later affects the former.<br>
	* testZZZ.html files documentation mencioned '{x,y}AxisFullGrid_' instead of the correct value'{x,y}AxisGrid_'.<br>
	* Fixed linear axis grid to show a line on the last tick (as opposed to the ordinal axis, that does not show the last line). When EndLine is active, it is drawn above the last grid line.<br>
	* Fixed bug in the positioning of linear scale labels that revealed it self (don't know why) only on time series charts * Fixed bug in time series scale range calculation when with a second axis * Fixed bug in the drawing of minor ticks on time series scales (date arithmetic issues)<br>
	* Fixed regression bug in ScatterCharts (DotChart, LineChart, StackedLineChart and StackedAreaChart) that caused null values to break line drawing.<br>
	* Fixed the visibility of the first grid line of a time series axis - it did not show because, in this case, the first tick is not on the origin.<br>
	* Fixed compatibility issue between jQuery.sparkline and protovis-msie when in IE8.<br>
	* heatgrid: +scalingType:'discrete' (interval-based, no color interpolation)<br>
	* tipsy w/ followMouse: don't fall out of window<br>
	* Heatgrid: ignore null values in min/max calculations; nullShape not taking correct index into account;<br>

		<h2>Concepts</h2>
		<p>
		
		This framework provides a standardized way to implement and publish dashboards to the Pentaho BI Platform.&nbsp
		The main goal of this framework is to give the user an <b> easy and friendly way to build dashboards.</b>. 
		<br>How can this be achieved? Take a look on this advantages: 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>No need to create additional JSP pages to deliver new dashboards.</li>
			<p><b>The user has no need to make jsp pages or even have the knowledge to deal <br>with this kind of technology.</b></p>
			
			<li>No need to create pentaho Action Sequences. </li>
			<p><b>For most cases,the user only has to set the needed components using a friendly syntax.</b></p>
			
			<li>The dashboard objects can be easy reused.</li>
			<p>The behaviors of dashboard objects (components) are related to their parameters values, and so <br><b>
			the user may use the same object on an different dashboard, modifying only the values<br> 
			of one or two parameters.</b></p>
			
			<li>Auto refresh and interaction between dashboard objects.</li>
			<p><b>The user doesn't need to concern about interaction between components.</b> The only thing 
			<br>the user must specify is what variable is bound to the object.</p>
			
			<li>The ability to auto generate a navigation bar that picks up new dashboards.</li>
			<p><b>A new dashboard was added? No need do modify the menu, the navigation bar will <br>
			deal and present the new one.</b></p>
			
			<li>New form objects, timeplot charts, tooltips, openstreet maps integration, etc, that makes <br> the dashboard richer. </li>
			<p><b>What is need to get all this new stuff to work? Just add the desired component.</b></p>
			
			<li><b>Build your one dashboard component library.</b></li>
			<p>When a particular component with a specific behavior is being used in all your projects,<br/> 
			just add it to your javascript library for later use.</p>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>Beyond this, the are other technical advantages that this framework brings to pentaho dashboard:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Enforces security via Pentaho's security model.</li>
			<li>Separation of the html design and component definition.</li>
			<li>Portlet integration.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Template Files</h2>
		
		<p> 

		Once again, the main goal is to reduced  time and effort to make a new dashboard. 
		The dashboard template files were build to <b>avoid adding always the same content</b> 
		(Navigation bar, javascript libraries, header, etc) to all the dashboards templates files. 
		Another objective that was accomplished with this solution was to <b>avoid the creation of a 
		template file for all the solution folders</b>. Finally, but not less important, all the  
		libraries  present in the template  are dynamically added by the Dashbaord.jsp <b>reducing the 
		size and computation of the templates.</b></p>

		<p>Here are the tree types of template files, used by cdf framework, 
		that are concatenated to the user template files:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>template-dashboard: 
			This template contains the header, the navigation bar and all the necessary JavaScript libraries</li><br>

			<li>template-dashboard-mantle:
			This template contains the header and all the necessary JavaScript  libraries. The navigation 
			menu was excluded, because mantle already have is own navigation approach.</li><br>
				
			<li>default-dashboard-template:
			When no template is present in the current solution folder, this template is present to the user.
			Can be used to present a content navigation page</li><br>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Two questions are raised here:<br>
		<br><b>How can we choose beteween the template-dashboard-mantle and the template-dashboard?</b>
		The answer is simple, just invoke the dashboard.jsp with the template request argument.(example: template=mantle).<br>
		<br><b>Can i modify the templates?</b> Of course, that's the purpose of template files. Just don't forget to include the navigatorComponent.

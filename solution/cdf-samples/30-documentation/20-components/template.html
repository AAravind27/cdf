		<h2>Components</h2>
		<p>
		
			The Component concept was born to simply the building of dashboard objects. Therefor<br> a Component is just 
			a simple JavaScript object that encapsulate all the object properties <br> and behaviors.
			But how much effort is necessary to make a component that:
			<ul>
				<li>Have a different behavior before and after execution.</li>
				<li>That interacts with other dashboard components</li>
				<li>At start up is just a simple bar chart but can be changed dynamically to a dial chart or even a table.</li>
				<li>The result presented by the component should change dynamically according to one or more parameter values. </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<br> 
		<p>The next paragraphs and chapters will show that all of this can be accomplished with very little effort.</p>
		<p><b>Basic Structure</b></p>
		
		<p>All components have a set of "properties" that are common to almost all of them and that are used to <br>
			control their life cycle and  behavior. Before the enumeration of this "properties", let's clarify<br>
			what is the life cycle of the component: 
		</p>
		<table style="border: 1px solid #000;" height="100px" width="400px">
		<tr><td align="center"> Life cycle diagram</td></tr>
		</table>
		
		<p><b>Component Properties</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>This property assumes a variety of values like jfreechart, timeplot, datepicker, etc.</li><br>
			<li>Name: This is the identifier of the component.</li><br>
			<li>Parameters: The parameter(s) is an array of identifiers that is used by the component to get or store 
			the desirably value in the correspondent object.</li><br>
			<li>Listeners: The variables that triggers the component update are stored in this array. This array is crucial in the iteration between components, because they can communicate using this together with their parameters. For example, if the selected value(parameter) of one selector changes, all the components that are "listening" on this parameter will react..</li><br>
			<li>PreExectuion/PreChange: Before the component is updated or presented to the user, this actions(functions) are executed. (The PreChange applies to form components and PreExections to the other ones).</li><br>
			<li>PostExectuion/PostChange:  After the component is updated or presented to the user, this actions(functions) are executed. (The PostChange applies to form components and PostExectuion to the other ones).</li><br>
			<li>Chart Definition: All the chart definitions(parameters) are defined in this javascript object.</li><br>
			<li>HTML Object: This is the identifier of the html object that will be replaced by the component content result.</li><br>
			<li>ExecuteAtStart: If set to false, the component will not execute at start. Although it will be updated as soon as one of his listeners have changed </li><br>
		<ul>

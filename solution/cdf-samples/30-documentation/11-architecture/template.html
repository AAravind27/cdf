		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		<p>
		
		<p>Here's a simplified diagram of the CDF Architecture:<p>
		<img src="/pentaho-style/images/warning.png">
			
		<p>The Dashboards.jsp page is called by the user and provides the access to all Dashboards.<br><br>
		As common within the Pentaho Solutions, this framework works on a set of assumptions concerning<br>
		the organization and naming of the folder structure and files: Each dashboard is defined in a <br>
		separate folder and must contain two files, index.xml and template.html.The index.xml is used to<br>
		identify the dashboard's name and description just as in any other folder in the Pentaho solution<br>
		 repository. The template.html file determines the dashboard's design.<br><br>
		The content layout as well as the static content are defined with regular HTML. Any kind of component <br>
		can be used as a placeholder, being "div" and "span" tags the most commonly used. These information <br>
		objects are defined as dashboard components. <br> <br>
		When the user calls up a dashboard, one or multiple components will be executed from the dashboard <br>
		library. Some of them will result in the executions of Action Sequences on the BI Platform. The platform <br>
		returns the results and the dashboard library will send the content to be displayed in the specified<br>
		tag back to the browser.
